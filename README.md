# Diabetes Readmission Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project presents a comparative analysis of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Deep Neural Networks for predicting hospital readmission among diabetes patients using clinical data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (1999–2008).

## Dataset

- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Size: ~101,000 patient encounters
- Features: Demographic, clinical, medication, and hospital utilization data
- Target: Diabetes readmission (binarized)

The dataset is anonymized and GDPR-compliant.

## Methods

- Data cleaning and missing value handling
- Categorical encoding and feature scaling
- Class imbalance handling
- Train–test split with stratification

### Models

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Deep Neural Network

### Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

## Results

Random Forest achieved the best predictive performance and generalization. Logistic Regression served as an interpretable baseline, while the Deep Neural Network showed limited effectiveness on structured tabular data.

## Conclusion

Model selection and preprocessing are critical in clinical prediction tasks. Ensemble tree-based methods outperform deep learning approaches on structured healthcare datasets in this study.
